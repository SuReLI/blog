## Curiosity Creates Diversity in Policy Search

We are pleased to announce the publication of the research paper titled "Curiosity Creates Diversity in Policy Search" in the journal Transactions on Evolutionary Learning and Optimization. 
This work was co-authored by Paul-Antoine, Emmanuel, Yann Besse and Dennis.

### Abstract of the Research
When searching for policies, reward-sparse environments often lack sufficient
information about which behaviors to improve upon or avoid. In such environments,
the policy search process is bound to blindly search for reward-yielding transitions
and no early reward can bias this search in one direction or another. A way to
overcome this is to use intrinsic motivation in order to explore new transitions
until a reward is found. In this work, we use a recently proposed definition of
intrinsic motivation, Curiosity, in an evolutionary policy search method. We
propose Curiosity-ES, an evolutionary strategy adapted to use Curiosity as a
fitness metric. We compare Curiosity-ES with other evolutionary algorithms
intended for exploration, as well as with Curiosity-based reinforcement learning,
and find that Curiosity-ES can generate higher diversity without the need for an
explicit diversity criterion and leads to more policies which find reward.

### Key Findings

* An algorithm that creates diversity without the need for an explicit diversity criterion.
* Curiosity-ES outperforms other exploration algorithms in sparse-reward scenarios.
* Empirical demonstration that combining the Curiosity exploration bonus with Evolutionary Strategies (ES) maintains a better balance in the inherent two-player game of exploration methods using uncertainty bonuses.
