## We're at EWRL

A lot of SuReLI members (10!) are at EWRL in Brussels. The weather is good, the invited talks are great, the poster sessions are busy: it's a great edition.

Adil was presenting work on [Revisiting the Static Model in Robust Reinforcement Learning](https://openreview.net/forum?id=ISHIWiPP97R) and Hedwin had a poster on [Learning State Reachability as a Graph in Translation Invariant Goal-based Reinforcement Learning Tasks](https://openreview.net/forum?id=snHJ-m11_8).

Oh, and Emmanuel is program chair :-).
