## EWRL 2022

We were at EWRL in Milan. It was a great gathering of the RL community. Lots of friendly meetings, great scientific insights, and Milan was very cool. Congratulations to the organizers for this great edition!

[CLOP](https://sureli.isae-supaero.fr/blog/2022/01/28/clop-iclr.html) was selected for an oral presentation, given by David.

The owl liked it a lot too! A few pictures below.
