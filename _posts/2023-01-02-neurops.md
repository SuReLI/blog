## NeurOps: Neural Operations for structured architectural optimization of ANNs

The [NeurOps](https://github.com/SuReLI/NeurOps) repository implements neural operations, as defined in [Maile et al. (2022)](https://openreview.net/pdf?id=gzhEGhcsnN), to enable architectural optimization via structured growing, pruning, and masking during the standard training process. It is currently available in PyTorch, with planned extensions to Jax/Flax and Julia/Flux (as done in [NORTH* Neurogenesis](https://github.com/k8lion/Neurogenesis)).
